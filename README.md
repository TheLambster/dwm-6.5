# dwm 6.5 (Dominic's config)

This comes with dwm 6.5 pre-compiled with a few patches installed, like uselessgap for gaps for the windows and status2d for a more *colorful* status, and the main font is changed from Monospace to the MesloLGL Nerd Font. So you need to install that font first, so I recommend you follow a quick tutorial on how to install fonts and get the font itself. I also recommend you use both slstatus and feh to make your desktop look very nice to post onto r/unixporn. Also, if you are wondering how to compile dwm, just do this command with Xorg installed:

```
sudo make install
```
or
```
sudo make clean install
```
This can also be used to revive old devices, like maybe a computer from the 90's, mainly since it only uses very little RAM, also, if you ever use this in a video, credit my GitHub or my YouTube channel, it will help out a lot, anyway, hopefully this config saves you tons of time from ricing!
